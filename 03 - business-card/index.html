            <h2>Writer, Researcher, Artist</h2>
            <p>I'm fascinated by change in all its forms and do my best to capture, understand, and communicate it to a general audience in brutally-concise formats. </p>
            <p>I like moving between rigor and imagination, words and image, theory and practice, and personal and political. Just about all of my work involves building datasets and archives, taking a class (or several), and designing something, even when I'm writing personal narratives. My go-to topics are history, memory, infrastructure, and collective action problems. </p>
            <p>I'm currently at work on a memoir, a series of speculative short-stories, and a STEM curriculum for social science and humanities students, including my past self.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I make comics, do physical crafts like origami, sewing, and woodworking, study mathematics, and build software.</p>
